# Open Ethics Tracing Protocol (OETP)

## Overview
The Open Ethics Tracing Protocol (OETP) is an open standard for tracing and validating agentic workflows in decentralized systems. It is designed to ensure ethical behavior in autonomous agents, with opt-in transparency, accountability, and oversight mechanisms built into the fabric of multi-agent orchestration.

Originally launched as part of the BeamTracks framework, OETP aims to grow into a broadly adopted protocol across open-source agentic platforms, tools, and runtime environments.

## Purpose
Modern autonomous systems have the potential for immense benefit—but also unprecedented harm. The purpose of OETP is to:

- Promote ethical alignment in agentic workflows
- Encourage transparency without sacrificing developer velocity
- Establish community-driven standards for DAGs and beyond
- Support decentralized reporting, tracing, and validation
- Lay the foundation for ethical interoperability between agentic platforms

## Core Components

### 1. `ethics_tag`
A string that denotes the ethical category of the workflow. Examples:
```json
"ethics_tag": "biometrics"
"ethics_tag": "financial"
"ethics_tag": "surveillance"
```

### 2. `guardian`
The name or ID of the agent responsible for evaluating ethical compliance. Example:
```json
"guardian": "CriticAgent"
```

### 3. `clearance_probability`
A float between 0 and 1 that determines the chance a given workflow will be evaluated by a decentralized Guardian Agent Network:
```json
"clearance_probability": 0.0001
```

### 4. `report_level`
Defines where violations or validation events are reported:
```json
"report_level": "blockchain" // or "private", "public"
```

## Initial Scope: DAG Validation

The first implementation of OETP focuses on validating Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) used in agentic workflows. DAGs define how agents coordinate and trigger actions. Ethical tracing ensures:

- Sensitive data isn’t routed through unauthorized agents
- Dangerous sequences are flagged (e.g., triggering real-world actions without approval)
- Ethical tags are respected during planning and execution

Example declaration:
```json
{
  "workflow_id": "capture_biometrics",
  "ethics_tag": "biometrics",
  "guardian": "CriticAgent",
  "clearance_probability": 0.0001,
  "report_level": "public"
}
```

## Long-Term Vision

OETP is designed to expand beyond DAGs. In the future, Guardian Agents may validate:

- Prompt structures passed to LLMs
- Agent memory stores (retention or deletion)
- Planning trees and chain-of-thought reasoning
- Peer-to-peer trust networks between agents
- Credentials or identity permissions
- Event logs and anomaly patterns

The Guardian Agent itself should be **modular**, allowing different validator types (e.g., `dag_validator`, `prompt_screener`, `memory_checker`) to plug into a shared tracing protocol.

Eventually, agents from different platforms (Elixir, Python, Rust, JS) should be able to participate in validation and tracing through a shared WebSocket or gRPC interface.

## Decentralized Guardian Agent Network

A longer-term goal is to create a decentralized network of Guardian Agents that communicate using a gossip protocol and share ethics validation data securely. These agents:

- Validate workflows probabilistically
- Report suspicious behavior
- Escalate issues to a decentralized ledger or blockchain if configured
- Accept or reject peer validations based on trust/reputation

The network is not about enforcement—it’s about **signal**. Making unethical behavior easier to detect, harder to hide, and culturally unacceptable.

---

## Broader Organizational Impact

OETP can:

- Help organizations prove ethical compliance to regulators and users
- Create a shared language for ethics in distributed systems
- Allow for internal governance layers around sensitive workflows
- Encourage interoperability between systems while maintaining safety standards

As open-source agentic platforms scale, this protocol allows for coordinated ethics **without centralization**—a powerful alternative to black-box proprietary oversight.
