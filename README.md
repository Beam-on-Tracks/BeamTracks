# BeamTracks

**Build. Orchestrate. Deploy. Multi-Agentic Workflows.**

BeamTracks is an open-source framework built with **Elixir**, **Gleam**, and **Dagger**, designed to streamline the creation of multi-agent systems via **Multi-Context Programming (MCP)**. It empowers developers to create autonomous, event-driven agents that can observe, plan, and act in dynamic scenarios.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **Multi-Context Programming (MCP)**: Abstract tasks across agents, time, and workflows.
- 🔌 **WebSocket Event Architecture**: Broadcast user events to agents, who self-subscribe and act independently.
- 🕸️ **Decoupled Agent Framework**: Each agent listens, plans, and executes without central coordination.
- 📊 **Dynamic + Static DAG Workflows**: Support for both declarative and runtime-generated workflows.
- 🧪 **Seamless Testing & Deployment**: Built-in support for experimentation and deployment pipelines.
- 📜 **Versioned Configuration Files**: Git-friendly and easily auditable.
- 🛡️ **Open Ethics Tracing Protocol**: Ensures ethical compliance with opt-in `ethics_tag` and Guardian agent monitoring.

## 🧭 Philosophies

### 🧠 Ethical AI by Default

AI agents must operate within human-aligned bounds.  
BeamTracks includes built-in prompt conventions and supports the **Open Ethics Tracing Protocol**, allowing developers to tag workflows with `ethics_tag`s and assign **Guardian Agents** like `CriticAgent` to monitor sensitive flows.

> ✅ Every workflow can opt-in to ethical tracing.  
> ⚖️ Future support for public audits and community-submitted guidelines.

### ⚙️ Convention over Configuration — Until Unreasonable

BeamTracks follows a simple rule: **don’t ask the developer to configure what can be sensibly assumed**.  
Inspired by the success of Ruby on Rails, BeamTracks favors developer velocity over early abstraction. Configuration is available when needed — particularly to enforce DAG rules or organizational policy — but never at the cost of flow.

> ⚡ Rapid prototyping by default.  
> 🛡️ Guardrails when you scale.

### 🧬 Scalable by Design

From toy bots to towns of agents.  
BeamTracks is designed to scale to **agentic towns** — systems of interconnected agents coordinating through real-time events and workflows. The architecture supports both single-node experiments and distributed deployments.

> 🧩 Agents are composable and event-aware.  
> 🌐 Cross-agent collaboration via WebSockets.  
> 💡 DAGs act as both playbooks and guardrails.

## 🚀 Getting Started

> **Note:** BeamTracks is currently in alpha. APIs and conventions may change.

### Prerequisites

- Elixir ≥ 1.16
- Gleam ≥ 1.0
- Dagger CLI
- Node.js (if using UI/WebSocket tooling)

---

## 🧱 Core Concepts

### Agents

Agents are autonomous processes that:

- Subscribe to relevant user or system events
- Plan and act independently
- Register or initiate workflows via DAGs

### Events

Events flow through WebSockets and trigger agent behavior. The system supports:

- User events (e.g., "User X said Y")
- System events (e.g., "Transcription complete")
- Planning events (e.g., "Plan generated for context Z")

### Workflows

Workflows are version-controlled DAGs with context constraints. Types include:

- **Static**: Defined ahead of time (YAML/JSON)
- **Dynamic**: Built at runtime based on current system state

### Ethics Protocol

The `Open Ethics Tracing Protocol` helps developers track and enforce ethical practices in workflows. Every agent or workflow can opt-in with:

```json
"ethics_tag": "sensitive-data",
"guardian": "CriticAgent"
```
